# Talent Trends

### A simple web application to get talents from warcraftlogs and let a user pick a spec. 

## Front End:
    - simple is better (bun? vue?)
    - OR html, css, js all generated by the server. (axum)
## Back End:
    - all code is a rust crate.
    - html is herdoc (r#) inside as a '&static to be used by front end.
    - our http server is axum.
    - it handles routing, logging (anyhow)
    - our API is simple.
    - GET (graphql?) from warcraft logs api of: 
        * top 10 logs for specified class/spec. 
        * we need to return the name, talent export string, and URL of log.
        * (maybe need to parse ourselve via serde_json OR use graphql api?)
